(Yes or No)\n\n## What is your overall Commons Configuration strategy? \nThe proposer here should outline their big picture thought process for the settings they chose. Also here they can highlight if their proposal is a fork, what they changed or perhaps any unique and/or contentious settings they chose and why.\n\n### [FORK MY PROPOSAL]() (link)\n\n# Module 1: Token Freeze and Token Thaw \n- **Token Freeze** is set to **10 weeks**, meaning that 100% of TEC tokens minted for Hatchers will remain locked from being sold or transferred for 10 weeks. \n- **Token Thaw** is set to **42 weeks**, meaning that from the end of Token Freeze, over the course of 42 weeks tokens minted for Hatchers gradually become liquid. At the end of 42 weeks 100% of the Hatchers' TEC tokens have become liquid.\n- The **Opening Price** is set to **2.00 wxDAI**, meaning at the outset of the Commons Upgrade the price to buy TEC on the Augmented Bonding Curve will be 2.00 wxDAI. \n\n### Strategy:\nHere the proposer can explain their parameter choices, briefly or in depth if they choose.\n\n### Data:\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Wk3jgGo.jpg)\n\n\n| # of Weeks | % of Tokens Released | Price Floor of Token |\n| ---------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |\n| 5 weeks    | 0%

wxDAI           |\n| 40 weeks   | 80%                  | 0.45 wxDAI           |\n| 52 weeks   | 100%                 | 0.00 wxDAI           |\n\n\n\n# Module 2: Augmented Bonding Curve (ABC)\n- **Commons Tribute** is set to **35%**, which means that 35% of the Hatch funds will go to the Common Pool and 65% will go to the Reserve Balance.\n- **Entry Tribute** is set to **5%** meaning that from every **BUY** order on the ABC, 5% of the order value in wxDAI is subtracted and sent to the Common Pool. \n- **Exit Tribute** is set to **15%** meaning that from every **SELL** order on the ABC, 15% of the order value in wxDAI is subtracted and sent to the Common Pool. \n\n### Strategy:\nHere the proposer can explain their parameter choices, briefly or in depth if they choose.\n\n###

**75%**, which means 75% of all votes must be in favour of a proposal for it to pass.\n- **Minimum Quorum** is set to **5%**, meaning that 5% of all tokens need to have voted on a proposal in order for it to become valid.\n- **Vote Duration** is **7 day(s)**, meaning that eligible voters will have 7 day(s) to vote on a proposal. \n- **Delegated Voting Period** is set for **5 day(s)**, meaning that Delegates will have 5 day(s) to use their delegated voting power to vote on a proposal. \n- **Quiet Ending Period** is set to **1 day(s)**, this means that 1 day(s) before the end of the Vote Duration, if the vote outcome changes, the Quiet Ending Extension will be triggered. \n- **Quiet Ending Extension** is set to **1 day(s)**, meaning that if the vote outcome changes during the Quiet Ending Period, an additional 1 day(s) will be added for voting.\n- **Execution Delay** is set to **8 hour(s)**, meaning that there is an 8 hour delay after the vote is passed before the proposed action is executed.  \n### Strategy:\nHere the proposer can explain their parameter choices, briefly or in depth if they choose.\n\n### Data:

meaning that Conviction will increase by 50% every 2 day(s).\n- **Minimum Conviction** is set to **1%**, this means that to pass a funding request for an infinitely small amount will still take a minimum of 1% of the total TEC currently active in the Conviction Voting application.\n- The **Spending Limit** is set to **20%**, which means that no more than 20% of the total funds in the Common Pool can be requested by single proposal. \n###  Strategy: \nHere the proposer can explain their parameter choices, briefly or in depth if they choose.\n\n\n### Data:
